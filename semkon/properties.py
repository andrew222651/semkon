It may (or may not) contain one or more formal propositions that have something to do with the codebase.
These would be written as developer documentation. They may be called "properties", "theorems", etc.
Extract all such propositions that satisfy the following criteria:
* They are written in natural language, not a programming language.
* They are in a mathematical style, like a computer scientist would write.
* They are explicitly labeled as a "property" or "theorem" or similar,
  and have an associated explicitly-labeled proof.

For example, there may be propositions about running times,
correctness, or auxiliary facts.
